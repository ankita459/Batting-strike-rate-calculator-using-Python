# Batting-strike-rate-calculator-using-Python

1. The first line prompts the user to input the number of runs scored and the second line prompts the user to input the number of balls faced. We use the int() function to convert the input values from strings to integers.

2. The third line calculates the batting strike rate by dividing the number of runs scored by the number of balls faced, and then multiplying the result by 100 to get a percentage value. We store the result in the strike_rate variable.

3. The fourth line uses the print() function to display the batting strike rate to the user. We use string formatting to round the result to 2 decimal places using the :.2f format specifier. The result is displayed as a string with the "{:.2f}" expression, which means "format the value of strike_rate as a float with 2 decimal places".

4. Finally, the code exits.
